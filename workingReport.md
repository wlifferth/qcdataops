## Quantifying Corruption
### Question 1: Did the Supreme Court case 'Citizens United v. FEC' impact the general nature of campaign contributions?
#### Did the overall amount of money flowing to federal congressional campaigns change from before CUvFEC to after it?  
Todo:  
+ Sum all contributions year before and after
+ Find average contributions per candidate, compare distributions
#### Did the makeup of contributions (individuals vs PACs) change in this time frame?
#### If there was some trend from cycle to cycle (periodicity, linear), how was that trend effected in this time frame?
