## Quantifying Corruption
### Question 1: Did the Supreme Court case 'Citizens United v. FEC' impact the general nature of campaign contributions?  
The various factors that influence campaign contributions are many as they are varied; is a candidate particularly divisive? Is a campaign's fund-raising capabilities above average? Are potential donors currently experiencing economic prosperity and therefore more likely to have surplus discretionary income? There are also many paradigms through which to view political donations--one broad dichotomy is to consider them either as an investment activity (when the donor believes their donation has a positive expected value for them and weighs this against their opportunity cost), or as a consumptive activity (when the donor believes their donation will further certain values or ideals that are personally agreeable, without thought of future payoff) (Ansolabehere 2003).  

These varied factors make it difficult to approach the question of whether or not 'Citizens United v FEC' had any effect in absolute terms. Certain elements could be controlled for, but many would be difficult to find relevant data on (i.e. how divise was a candidate?). However, we can approach the question of "Did the ruling of 'Citizens United v FEC' achieve what it wanted to achieve?". This requires at least a moderate understanding of the case's content, and the specifics of the ruling itself.  

I am not a legal scholar, but my working high level framework is as follows:
> 'Citizens United v FEC' addressed a potential imbalance in campaign finance, and fundamentally posited that there was too much money flowing into the hands of candidates via Political Action Committees (PACs). This case established the basis for Super Political Action Committees (Super PACs) with the belief that there was currently money going to PACs that more justly should flow to Super PACs. Therefore, if PACs continued to play as important a role as they had prior, 'Citizens United v FEC' couldn't've had the effect it intended.

#### Did the overall amount of money flowing to federal congressional campaigns change from before CUvFEC to after it?  
Todo:  
+ Sum all contributions year before and after
+ Find average contributions per candidate, compare distributions
#### Did the makeup of contributions (individuals vs PACs) change in this time frame?  
Todo:
+ Plot percentage of total contributions that were PAC driver and those that were Individual driven
#### If there was some trend from cycle to cycle (periodicity, linear), how was that trend effected in this time frame?
